Activity 1:
1. Team, Game, Card classes
2. currentCard, currentTeam
3. runGame(), updateScore(), switchTeam()
4. all three
5. first ask how many teams you are going to have in the game, then create all the celebrity cards from a provided list. Then shuffle the cards, pick a card for the currentTeam to guess. Start the timer, and let the team play. If the team guesses correctly, add a point to their counter. If they pass, remove a point. Keep going until the timer runs out or there are no cards left. Switch the team, and repeat until there are no more cards.
6. Computers -- display information, compute things, be a general assistant. Needs hardware to work. You need to know what sort of hardware it has, so yes, you need objects to represent the hardware
7. my pardner thought it was a wonderful idea

Activity 2:
1. The constructor initializes the instance variables
2. The heading describes the permission and the instance name
3. name and clue
4. getClue(), getName()
7. celebrity class has one constructor, but if we wanted to we could implement either Celebrity(String name) for when we only want the name to be initialized or Celebrity() for a default character or Celebrity(String clue) for when we are quirky

Activity 3:
1. JFrame - the background of the window - allows you to change its size and border and menu bar  
2. private ArrayList<Celebrity> celebGameList;
3. no, because you need to show the celebrity in the GUI
